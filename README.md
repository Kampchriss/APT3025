# Movie Recommendation Clustering

This project demonstrates movie recommendation through clustering users based on their movie ratings using K-Means clustering. The code is implemented in Python using Google Colab.

## Overview

The repository contains Python code that performs the following tasks:

- Loading and exploring user ratings for different movies.
- Applying K-Means clustering to group users into two clusters based on their movie ratings.
- Predicting cluster labels for new users using test data.

## Code Structure

- `clustering_movie_recommendation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the movie recommendation clustering.

## Getting Started

1. Open the `clustering_movie_recommendation.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Execute the cells in order to load the data, perform clustering, and make predictions.
3. Explore the results and predictions.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn

Test Data
The test data (testData) contains ratings for new users to predict their cluster labels.
